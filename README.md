Here u will find a simple Discord bot with <abbr title="'Large Language Model' or also know for Artificial itelligence">LLM</abbr> integration.
Its still ver WIP but has some neat features.
Anyway dont look to good at the code it's yeah not the most beautiful especially the part about the LLM.
Also when u want to use the bot u need to install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) and until i add it the models but thats all very simple trust me.
